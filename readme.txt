Sample project showcasing databinding oddities in a Uwp project.

The main page contains 2 textboxes. The upper one is databound via the implicit datacontext, to the Message property. THe second textbox implicitly to the Message property of the main page, referenced by element name. The second one works, the first one doesn't.
